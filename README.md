## Description
Personal script dump

### fancam block bot
Block all fancams under a tweet! A python script to help block fancams under any tweet without blocking other conversations. Example of tweet that's flooded with unhelpful fancams [here](https://twitter.com/hangyul_hourly/status/1306063969321271298).

### block retweeters
Block (or mute) retweeters of a tweet! If you wish to not ever engage in or encounter an unreasonable conversation on twitter with people who interact with a certain tweet.

### kindlehighlight
Export highlights of a book from [Kindle](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) to csv file for uploading to Notion Reading List. HTML source code should be saved in `txt`. You can then import the csv file to Notion then move the file into the book page as inline table. For implementation on Notion check [here](https://www.notion.so/azukacchi/Reading-List-35ae3495610e4721a6d331cbda063c18).

### read-goodreads
Scrape book list field according to [Notion Reading List page](https://www.notion.so/azukacchi/Reading-List-35ae3495610e4721a6d331cbda063c18). HTML source code should be saved in `txt`. Import the csv file to Notion then drag to merge with the existing table. Note: somehow "Merge with CSV" option doesn't work, so the csv file should be imported then moved to the page. Example of Goodreads read book page [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4240208-azka-nur-afifah?ref=nav_mybooks&sort=date_read).

### otptags
I'd like to see how my *rare* otp is growing (or if it's growing at all, lol). Scrape the total works count in your favorite otp tags on AO3 with the number of works for each age rating.

### historywordcount
Count the number of AO3 fics you've read with the total word count. "Viewing History" should be enabled first (My Preferences >> Misc >> Turn on Viewing History).
