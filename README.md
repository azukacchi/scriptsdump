## Description
Personal script dump

### fancam block bot
Block all fancams under a tweet! A python script to help block fancams under any tweet without blocking other conversations. Example of tweet that's flooded with unhelpful fancams [here](https://twitter.com/hangyul_hourly/status/1306063969321271298).

### block retweeters
Block (or mute) retweeters of a tweet! If you wish to not ever engage in or encounter an unreasonable conversation on twitter with people who interact with a certain tweet.

### kindlehighlight
Export highlights of a book from [Kindle](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) to csv file for uploading to Notion Reading List. HTML source code should be saved in `txt`. You can then import the csv file to Notion then move the file into the book page as inline table. For implementation on Notion check [here](https://www.notion.so/azukacchi/Reading-List-35ae3495610e4721a6d331cbda063c18).

### read-goodreads
Scrape book list field according to [Notion Reading List page](https://www.notion.so/azukacchi/Reading-List-35ae3495610e4721a6d331cbda063c18). HTML source code should be saved in `txt`. Import the csv file to Notion then drag to merge with the existing table. Note: somehow "Merge with CSV" option doesn't work, so the csv file should be imported then moved to the page. Example of Goodreads read book page [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/4240208-azka-nur-afifah?ref=nav_mybooks&sort=date_read).
